### Blockchain Engineer

We’re a blockchain project, we need blockchain engineers! We know there's not a lot of people that have blockchain experience, so we don’t expect that you have this experience already, but it will help to have relatable experience. All our code is written in Go, so that’s a plus too.

### Front-end UI/UX designers and developers

We have several user facing projects that need a facelift and many upgrades. We’re looking for a front-end developer that also has a keen eye for design. Angular experience preferred.

### Marketing Manager / Assistants

We need people to know about GoChain, to build on GoChain and to use GoChain. This is where marketing comes in. Are you the one?
